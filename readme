Vet, a testing library for C

Vet is intended to be a minimal environment in which to test C
programs. Each test runs in its own address space, and tests may spawn
child tests. Vet gracefully handles signals and crashes from the test
processes.

See vet.h and vet_macros.h for the public interfaces, and
tests/vet_vet.c for a simple self-test example.
